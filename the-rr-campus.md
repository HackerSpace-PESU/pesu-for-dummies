# The RR Campus
The RR Campus is the biggest campus of PESU, in terms of infrastructure.

## Notable Locations in and around RR Campus

### The MRD Block
The MRD Block, also called as Silver Jubilee Block, is the main administrative block of this campus. All admissions and administration happens here.
* **The Library:** It is on the first floor of the MRD Block, and has a large collection of academic books, and an e-library too. You can borrow textbooks from here, or read them in the library.
* **MRD Auditorium:** An auditorium where most of the seminars and  orientations are conducted. It's got balcony seats too!

### The GJB Block
The GJB Block, short for Golden Jubilee Block, is the biggest and the most conspicuous block in the campus. It is currently under construction, but many amenities in it are already functional.
* **Jag's Nest (Assessment Centre):** This is the assessment centre with 20 rooms full of computers, for conducting the PESSAT examinations, ISAs and ESAs. It is usually peaceful in here, but only until the exams are over!
* **GJB Canteen:** The GJB Canteen is a spacious cafeteria, with a large seating capacity and aesthetic design. It is usually very crowded on a normal day. Prices are affordable, and cuisine varies from North Indian, South Indian, Chinese, chats, mocktails and desserts in here.
* **Cafe Coffee Day:** Do I need to explain what's this? You wanna grab a quick coffee? Then this is your place!
* **Two-storey Gym:** *content goes here*
* **Basketball, Badminton and other courts:** Not yet functional, but are really breathtaking to see.

### The BE Block
This is the second tallest block in the campus, and has classrooms for various courses here. Engineering courses from second year have their classes in here. It has six elevators to serve 13 floors.
* **13th Floor Cafeteria:** On the topmost floor, there is an open-air cafeteria with vegetarian and non-vegetarian stuff. Decent seating capacity, too.
* **Sol Sac:** On the same 13th floor, there are three study areas, and all of them are really good:
	* Open-air study area: On the other side of the cafeteria, it has a very limited capacity, but the atmosphere is really good.
	* Indoor study area: Another spacious study area with some really interesting architecture. And a very huge fan on the ceiling.
	* Silent Reflections: A section inside the indoor study area, as the name suggests, a silent place to spend time with yourselves for productivity. The wooden architecture makes it look like a Victorian era library, and the dim lighting adds to the ambience, too.
* **Controller of Examinations Office:** In the basement of BE Block lies the CoE office, where you can get exam-related tasks done, like stuff to do in case you missed an ISA or ESA and so on.
* **BE Block Stores:** Opposite to the entrance of BE Block lie 4 shops, three of them being small bakeries where you can get light snacks to fill your tummies. The fourth one is the legendary Campus Mart, which is a small stationery shop. It is useful if you have an assignment in the next hour and haven't got any spare blue books on you.

### The F Block
The F Block, also called as Panini Block, is the oldest block of the campus. This is where the first years of BTech start their PESU life. It has 8 floors, and two elevators. Every floor has a boys' and a girls' washroom. There are labs on many floors too.

***

### Boys' Hostel
The boys' hostel gets a special mention because it has two canteens:
* **Hostel Mess:** South Indian cuisine, vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Unlimited breakfast for ₹50 and unlimited lunch for ₹60.
* **Namdhari Mess:** North Indian cuisine, pure vegetarian, more protein based food for the fitness freaks. Unlimited breakfast for ₹40 and unlimited lunch for ₹80.<br>
And yeah, the girls' hostel is NOT in the campus.

### Sutta Gully
There is no student in PES RR Campus who hasn't visited the Sutta Gully ever in their time in PESU. Just a few metres walk away from the campus, it has shops selling some of the best food you can think of. Examples include: 99 Variety Dosas, Shawarma Rolls, Momos, Kathi Rolls, Fruit juices and milkshakes, and some of the best stuff you could think of.
