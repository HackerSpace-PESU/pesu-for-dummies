## GENERAL STUFF
This is the most important section of this guide, so read each and every bit.

### RULES
* ID Card is a must, no matter what else you bring. This is to ensure security in the campus. Also, should you forget to bring your ID Card, you can always show your profile in the PESU App to gain entry to the campus.
* A minimum of 80 - 85% of attendance is necessary in every subject to be eligible to write the end sems. Did I say every subject? Yes, attendance is taken subject-wise in universities, not day-wise. Please do remember that.

***

### CLASSES
Here's the timetable for majority of the days:
|      1      |       2      |     Break     |       3       |       4       |     Lunch     |       5       |       6       |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 8:15 - 9:15 | 9:15 - 10:15 | 10:15 - 10:45 | 10:45 - 11:45 | 11:45 - 12:45 | 12:45 - 13:30 | 13:30 - 14:30 | 14:30 - 15:30 |

In the first hour, there is a pardon of upto 10 minutes, which means you will be allowed into the class until 8:25, after which you might be allowed into the class but without attendance. No pardon for classes after breaks.

***

### STUFF YOU SHOULD HAVE
* A book for notes. A 5-subject spiral bound book is usually given by the university, so that's more than enough.
* Blue Book: A thin, 16-page book (with an obvious blue paper bind) used to write assessments and other lab exams. Costs around ₹10 - ₹12, so buy atleast 2 for each subject.
* 

***

### THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM
There are three types of examinations/tests held in PES:

#### Class Assignments / Lab assignments
Normal assignments of around 20 marks, conducted in the class and written in blue books. 1 assignment is conducted for every unit, and the aggregate marks are considered for the final score.
!!!info
There are no lab exams for Physics or Chemistry. Only for C and Python.
!!!

#### ISA (Internal Semester Assessment)
One of the most important assessments. Conducted in the assessment centre, it is a Computer-Based Test (CBT). 
* There is 1 ISA per unit, and is for 20 marks, for 30 minutes.
* The timetable will be sent a week before, and the seating allotment is shown in the app on the day of the respective exam.
* Majority of the questions are MCQs and some of them are descriptive, for which the answers should be typed in the PC.
* A rough sheet will be given for calculations.
* You can (usually) leave the exam centre as soon as you finish the exam.

#### ESA (End Semester Assessment)
* The final test of your bravery. It is a 100-mark examination for every subject.
* Written in the assessment centres, and seating allotment is given. Spans for 3 hours.
* Completely descriptive. You will be given an answer booklet for the exam. 
* The questions are displayed on the PC, and you can either write the answers or type the answers.
* You can't leave the exam hall after 45 mins of start of exam, and before 10 mins of end of exam.

### THE PRN AND SRN
PRN (short for ) and SRN (short for ) are two unique IDs that are provided to you.
* The PRN format is `PESxyyyyzzzzz`, where `x` is your campus code (1 is RR, 2 is EC), `yyyy` is the year of admission, and `zzzzz` is a unique number. Examples: PES1202212345.
* The SRN format is `PESxzzyyccnnn`, where `x` is campus code, `zz` specifies your general qualification (UG for undergraduate), `yy` for year of admission, `cc` is course code (CS, EC, EE, AM, ME etc) and `nn` is a unique number. Example: PES2UG22EC123. \[ sorry if I doxxed someone :') \]
